# Burger Logger App

![license-badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-None-blue)

## Description
This web-app allows the user to type in the name of a burger they want to eat. Once they click 'submit' the burger is displayed on the lefthand side of the page in a list. Each entry in that list is dispalyed with a 'devour' button. When that button is clicked, the burger is removed from the first list and displayed in the second on the righthand side of the page. This app utilizes MySQL to store the entries in a database so that they will appear when the page is reloaded.
